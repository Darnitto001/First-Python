# Arithimetic Operators

x = 40
y = 32
print(x+y)
print(x-y)
print(x*y)
print(x/y)
print(x % y) # hii ni modulos - returns the remainder after the operation


#Comparison Aparatous
print(x < y)
print(x > y)
print(x <= y)
print(x >=y)
print(x == y) #equal to
print(x != y)#not equal to


#Assignment operatoes
a = 10
print(a)

a += 2

print(a)


#Logic Operators - and, or, not
print(34 < 50 and 34 > 50)
